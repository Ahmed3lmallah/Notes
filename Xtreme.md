# Xtreme Programming

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES

Here are some popular development methodologies:
* Waterfall
* Spiral
* Agile
* Scrum
* Extreme Programming

## XP VS. SCRUM

1. Iteration length
	* XP: 1-2 weeks
	* Scrum: 2-4 weeks
1. Flexibility During Sprint
	* XP: Yes
	* Scrum: No
1. Enforces Engineering Practices
	* XP: Yes, Paired Programming, TDD, Unit Testing, Constant Code Review
	* Scrum: Nope

## XP SPRINT FLOW

1. User Story Creation (Product team)
1. Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM) (Product & Dev teams)
1. Group Tasking (Dev team)
1. Test-Driven Development w/ Paired Programming
1. Sprint Retrospective

## ROLES: 

### 1. CUSTOMER

Defines the user stories and the respective acceptance tests
	* Preferably on-site to have constant feedback

### 2. XP MANAGER (PRODUCT MANAGER)

In the middle between the customer and developer
	* Holds the IPM and prioritizes user story order

### 3. DEVELOPER

* Analyzes, designs, programs, and integrates the system
* Estimates the difficulty/complexity of all stories
* Tracks velocity of what they can deliver

## USER STORIES

* Stories define a feature from the user’s perspective
* Length of a user story should not be longer than an iteration
	* If it lasts longer, it should be broken down into multiple stories

## ITERATION PLANNING MEETING (IPM)

* At the start of every iteration, the team meets to choose which stories they’ll commit to
* User stories are sized (S,M,L,XL) to track velocity over multiple sprints
* User stories are prioritized

## TASKING MEETING

* The stories chosen in the IPM are broken into manageable tasks
* Ideally, tasks should be able to be done in parallel
* Tasks should be ordered by priority
* Higher priority tasks should be delegated first

## PAIR PROGRAMMING

* Pair programming is two developers actively working and thinking about a problem
* One just happens to be typing - both are thinking
* Developers keep each other focused and constantly review code
* No code is written alone!

## RETROSPECTIVE

* A kind of "group therapy" for the sprint - how did it go?
* Usually, three columns are created on the whiteboard:
	* Unhappy: Create action items to fix
	* Neutral: Keep watch and be wary of these items
	* Happy: Keep doing these things!
